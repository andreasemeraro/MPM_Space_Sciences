## INTRODUCTION ##
This repository is made as a result of a project during the [Master in Mathematical and Physical Methods for Space Sciences](https://mpmss.i-learn.unito.it/). 
In the following part a brief description of each code will be made:
   - [Celestial mechanics and astrodynamics](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Celestial%20mechanics%20and%20astrodynamics): orbit.py defines the class that evaluates orbit parameters (converting from cartesian to keplerian or viceversa). congiunzione_orbite.py is able to propagate the equations of motions for two objects, in a given time and a given number of times along the orbit. Given a threshold, the code computes the points where the two objects are sufficiently close (in 2ver, it determines only the exact point at which the objects come close enough, warns for a conjunctions under the threshold and breaks the loop). There are also plots, and two ways to interpolate space points, in order to determine distance and time of closest encounter for a limited set of points chosen by the user. The code is a preliminary study, so it is not supposed to work without a bit of manipulating.
   - [Costellation](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Costellation):
   - [Data_Analysis](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Data_Analysis): BONINO: File ''Esame1.R'' performs a descriptive analysis of flux1 of the Sun observation data set. It works on flux1, flux1diff (called ''s1diff''), checks the residual features. File ''regression_esame1.R'' performs a scatter plot of the two fluxes to verify an eventual relationship amog them.
   - [Launcher and propulsion system](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Launcher): File ''Lanciatore.xlsx'' performs the stage optimization of the launcher through Newton Rapson method. File ''Propulsion_'' calculates the total amount of propellant necessary for the trip from LEO to MLO, using Tsiolkovskyâ€™s rocket equation.
   - [Machine_Learning](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Machine_Learning):
   - [Orbit perturbation](https://github.com/andreasemeraro/MPM_Space_Sciences/tree/main/Orbit%20perturbation):matlab file ''Ex_10_6_J2_final.m'' computes the effects of J2 mars gravitational field and provides an average value of the norm of a_J2 (calculated during 700 days on mars orbit), that is the perturbing acceleration of the due to J2 effects.
